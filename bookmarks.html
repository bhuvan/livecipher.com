            <p>I did my primary schooling at Blesso Matriculation School, Ambur.
            Ambur is 7 kms far away from my village. My principal name is Mr.Sathya.
            He was our Correspondent cum Principal. I just wish to recollect the
            names of my Teachers from my Kinder classes. </p>

                            <p>My class Miss for LKG & UKG classes was Ms.Nirmala.
            My class Miss for 1st class was Ms.Suganthi. My class Miss for 2nd Class
            was Ms.Angavai. She was responsible for my handwritting which was good
            then and average now. My class Miss for 3rd Class was Ms.Jayanthi. She
            was a tall lady. My class Master for 4th Class was Mr.Samsuddin. I was a
            class leader then. I used to report him the guys/gals who were making
            noise. I was one among the favourite students for him. Mr.Sathya used to
            come for English. He came for me when i was in 4th class. Till this
            class i used to score first grade, O grade in my progress report. I
            never had a need to forger my Father's signature.</p>
                            <p>After 4th class i got double promotion to 6th class.
            My father shifted my school. 6th class I did at Hindu Higher Secondary
            School, Ambur. My class Master for 6th class was Mr.Sambasivam. He used
            to come for Maths. I scored 3rd or 4th rank in my 6th class.</p>
                            <p>After 6th class, my father again shifted my school. I
            joined my 7th class in National Higher Secondary School, Gudiyattam. My
            Class Teacher for 7th class was Ms.JayaBharathi. She came for Science. I
            scored 4th or 5th rank in and from my 7th class.</p>
                            <p>Gudiyattam is 20kms far away from my village. So, I
            was kept in Hostel. I used to come to my home every week. My hostel
            Warden is Mr.Eganathan. He was a real guardian for me. I can't count the
            days on which he punished us for various reasons.</p>
                            <p>My Class Teacher for 8th Class was Ms.Bharathi. My
            Class Teacher for 9th Class was Ms.Surya. She came for Tamil. My Class
            Master for 10th Class was Mr.Rajendran. He came for Maths.</p>
                            <p>I completed my 10th class in 1997 year. I scored
            444/500 in my 10th class. I suppose, 474 was the first score in our
            school. My class girl named Ms.Anurekha had scored the same. She was an
            intelligent girl and she was my class leader as well.</p>

                            <p>After my 10th class I joined my diploma. I did my
            Diploma in Computer Techology (DCT) at Central Polytechnic, Tharamani,
            Chennai. I was left in Hostel again.</p>
                            <p>My college days are evergreen memories of my life. I
            really enjoyed a lot at my hostel and class as well. I completed my
            diploma in 2000 year. I scored 88.8% in my diploma. Currently, i am
            working for <a href=http://www.collab.net>CollabNet</a>. I truly enjoy
            using and contributing little part to opensource softwares. Should you
            require my updated profile, please contact me.
                            <p>On academic front, i am doing my final year MCA in
            correspondence (to be frank, i'm doing it for quite some
            time!). More recent information about me can be found in my <a
            href=http://bhuvanbk.livejournal.com/>blog</a> web page.</p>
