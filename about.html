					<p><b>About Me!</b></p>
				
            <p>OK, let me attempt to recollect my memory since my
            Primary school ... If you think you will not like it, please
            move on to next page!</p>
            <p>I did my primary schooling at Blesso Matriculation
            School, <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambur">Ambur</a>.
            Ambur is 7 kms far away from my village. My principal name is Mr.Sathya.
            He was our Correspondent cum Principal. I just wish to recollect the
            names of my Teachers from my Kinder classes. </p>

                            <p>My class Miss for LKG &amp; UKG classes was Ms.Nirmala.
            My class Miss for 1st class was Ms.Suganthi. My class Miss for 2nd Class
            was Ms.Angavai. She was responsible for my handwritting which was good
            then and average now. My class Miss for 3rd Class was Ms.Jayanthi. She
            was a tall lady. My class Master for 4th Class was Mr.Samsuddin. I was a
            class leader then. I used to report him the guys/gals who were making
            noise. I was one among the favourite students for him. Mr.Sathya used to
            come for English. He came for me when i was in 4th class. Till this
            class i used to score first grade, O grade in my progress report. I
            never had a need to forger my Father's signature.</p>
                            <p>After 4th class i got double promotion to 6th class.
            My father shifted my school. 6th class I did at Hindu Higher Secondary
            School, Ambur. My class Master for 6th class was Mr.Sambasivam. He used
            to come for Maths. I scored 3rd or 4th rank in my 6th class.</p>
                            <p>After 6th class, my father again shifted my school. I
            joined my 7th class in National Higher Secondary School, <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudiyattam">Gudiyattam</a>. My
            Class Teacher for 7th class was Ms.JayaBharathi. She came for Science. I
            scored 4th or 5th rank in and from my 7th class.</p>
                            <p>Gudiyattam is 20kms far away from my village. So, I
            was kept in Hostel. I used to come to my home every week. My hostel
            Warden is Mr.Eganathan. He was a real guardian for me. I can't count the
            days on which he punished us for various reasons.</p>
                            <p>My Class Teacher for 8th Class was Ms.Bharathi. My
            Class Teacher for 9th Class was Ms.Surya. She came for Tamil. My Class
            Master for 10th Class was Mr.Rajendran. He came for Maths.</p>
            
                            <p>I must also make a special mention about
                            my Tuition master Mr.Muralidaran. He is such
                            a great teacher for any student. He is one
                            of reason why I loved the subject, Maths. I
                            was confident that I would score Centum in
                            my 10th examination. He was confident that I
                            would not score Centum before I make
                            careless silly mistakes often. You know
                            what? I did not score Centum, but only 95 as
                            I wrote one of theorm wrong in the
                            examination. These kind of incident clearly
                            indicate that I was over confident and we
                            must agree when an experienced folk attempt
                            to correct us.</p>
                            <p>I completed my 10th class in 1997 year. I scored
            444/500 in my 10th class. I suppose, 474 was the first score in our
            school. My class girl named Ms.Anurekha had scored the same. She was an
            intelligent girl and she was my class leader as well.</p>

                            <p>After my 10th class I joined my diploma. I did my
            Diploma in Computer Techology (DCT) at Central Polytechnic, Tharamani,
            Chennai. I was left in Hostel again.</p>
                            <p>My college days are evergreen memories of my life. I
            really enjoyed a lot at my hostel and class as well. I got
            real long time friends in the college. Few from the
            hostel and few day students. At least 5 of us are in regular
            touch even now, almost after 9years. They are: Ulaganathan,
            Balaji, Thirumeni, Thennarasu and Gokulan. The Hostel experience
            have given me an ability to manage my day-to-day activities on my
            own. I was able to manage my expense in a sensible manner.
            This experience educated me on how to be accountable for
            every activity.</p>
            <p>I completed my
            diploma in 2000 year. I scored 88.8% in my diploma. After
            completing my Diploma, I joined the company <a href="http://bksystems.co.in">BK
            SYSTEMS</a>. They provide telecom based solutions including
            Integrated Voice Response System (IVRS) and Call Center
            solutions primarily for Banking and Financial companies. I
            worked here for over 4 years and currently i am
            working for <a href="http://www.collab.net">CollabNet</a>. I truly enjoy
            using and contributing little part to opensource software. Should you

                            <p>On academic front, I completed Master
                            of Computer Applications (MCA). 
            I am also doing Master of Business Administration (MBA)
            -- International Business in Alagappa University. More recent

            through the complete detail!</p>
